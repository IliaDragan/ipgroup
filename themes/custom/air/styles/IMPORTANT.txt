UPDATE - Wed Mar 13 09:57:40 CET 2013

I(tg@peytz.dk) have updated the way this project works 
with LESS.

Previously this project used the Drupal module 
'LESS CSS Preprocessor' to process LESS files.
- http://drupal.org/node/1807852

For consistancy with other Peytz projects and to make it 
easier for future developers to work with, I have moved 
away from a module based approach. 

The /styles folder is now structured to enable developers 
to compile the CSS using desktop apps (See below).

The side effect off this change is that the 'new' .LESS 
files have a 'classic' .CSS structure. (eg: If you look 
in the .less files you will not see any LESS style nesting)!

Note that future developers CAN use LESS nesting, variables, 
mixins and functions as per normal.


Important information about stylesheets:
========================================

EVERYTHING IN STYLES/CSS ARE VOLATILE!

All styles for the Air theme are generated 
via LESS. Because of this, all changes to to the CSS 
folder is bound to be overridden at some point.

You should only do CSS changes to LESS files (*.less) in 
the styles/less folder, and compile the result into 
styles/css.

NEVER (!!) UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE, SHOULD YOU CHANGE 
ANYTHING IN STYLES/CSS BY HAND. EVER!

Recommend using a LESS app for this task, and there are 
several. PCO recommends the first one for OS X:

OS X:                     http://incident57.com/less/
OS X, Windows & Linux:    http://wearekiss.com/simpless

Have fun coding CSS with variables, mixins and functions!
